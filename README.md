# hub-page
The forward-facing introduction to volunteers on how to start a ForkTheCity instance for their own community. Very vibe-coded. Looking for people to build a functional platform. If you're curious for more information, please visit our [organization page](https://github.com/ForkTheCity). We will add issues soon (or you can!)
